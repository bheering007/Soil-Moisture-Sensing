Overview
The AquaMate System is an integrated environmental monitoring and control system developed on the Arduino platform. It utilizes various sensors and devices to manage and automate the care of aquatic environments and plant watering systems. This document outlines the system's main components and functionalities, providing essential information for setup, operation, and maintenance.

System Components
1. Soil Moisture Sensor (soilDetector)
Description: Monitors the moisture level in the soil using a capacitive sensing technique.
Functionality:
Reads moisture levels through a probe.
Computes an exponential moving average (EMA) to smooth out readings.
Detects and handles sensor errors effectively.
2. Ultrasonic Water Level Sensor (resSense)
Description: Measures the water level in a tank to ensure adequate water availability for pumping.
Functionality:
Uses ultrasonic pulses to measure distance to the water surface.
Determines if the tank's water level is sufficient for pump operation.
3. Water Pump Controller (waterPump)
Description: Controls a water pump to regulate water flow based on soil moisture needs.
Functionality:
Turns the pump on or off based on predefined moisture thresholds and tank water level.
4. LCD Display (lcdScreen)
Description: Provides real-time status updates and system messages.
Functionality:
Displays current soil moisture, water tank status, and operational messages.
Shows error or warning messages when sensor readings fall outside acceptable ranges.
Setup and Installation
Hardware Assembly:
Connect soil moisture sensors, ultrasonic sensor, and water pump to designated Arduino pins.
Ensure all components are securely connected and positioned according to their operational requirements.
Software Configuration:
Upload the provided Arduino sketches to your Arduino board.
Configure threshold values and settings in the code as per your specific environmental conditions.
Testing:
Perform initial tests to ensure all sensors and outputs are functioning correctly.
Adjust configurations as necessary based on initial test results.
Operation
Normal Operation:
The system automatically reads soil moisture and water levels at defined intervals.
Based on these readings, the water pump is activated or deactivated to maintain optimal soil moisture.
Status updates and alerts are displayed on the LCD.
Error Handling:
The system is designed to detect and report critical failures such as sensor malfunctions and low water levels.
In case of an error, corrective suggestions or actions are displayed on the LCD screen.
Maintenance
Regularly check and clean all sensors and mechanical components.
Replace sensors or parts as needed to ensure accurate readings and reliable operation.
Periodically update the software to incorporate improvements and bug fixes.
Conclusion
The AquaMate System provides a comprehensive solution for automated environmental control. With detailed monitoring and responsive controls, it ensures optimal conditions with minimal manual intervention. This guide should serve as a starting point for setting up and enjoying the benefits of the AquaMate System.
